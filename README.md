## Microlife Calculator
We all know that when we exercise we live longer, 1 ML (microlife) is equivalent to 30 minutes of your life. You therefore lose 48 MLs of your life everyday. But that isn't all - the decisions we make in the day have the ability add to those MLs (decrease life expectancy) or to subtract from those MLs (increase life expectancy).

Building a life activity tracker, which will tell us how much our life expectancy has increased or decreased based on a day's activities. Use a single JSON file to store information about the user and their activities.
